# Extension Icons

You need to create icon files for the extension. Create a folder called `icons` inside the `extension` folder and add these three PNG files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can use any image editor or online tool to create these icons. A simple shield or focus-related icon would work well.

Alternatively, you can use a placeholder image generator or create simple colored squares with text for now.

## Quick Icon Creation

If you want to quickly create placeholder icons, you can:

1. Create a simple SVG with a shield icon
2. Convert it to PNG at the required sizes
3. Save them in the `extension/icons/` folder

Or use an online tool like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/

For now, the extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon.
